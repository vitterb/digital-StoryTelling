Co-pilot: did you hear the commotion in the hallway last night? 

EnterActor:Ji-Yeon

Ji-Yeon: Yes, It woke me up for a little while.
Co-pilot: Must be an Irish thing, such behaviour would not pass in Korea! 
Ji-Yeon: You are right, my friend.
Ji-Yeon: Maybe we should request a different hotel next time.
Co-Pilot: Might as well, we are pilots after all, we need our sleep!
